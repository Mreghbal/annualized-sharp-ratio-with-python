"""
    Compute the annualized sharp ratio of a set of returns:
    1- First, convert the annual riskfree rate to per period.
    2- Second, use two other functions for annuallized returns and volatilities.
    3- We should infer the periods per year.
    4- Periods could be day, month or quarter in dataset.
